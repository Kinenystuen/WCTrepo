    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> To secure his/her website from web-security attacks I would advise a potential client to:
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure to have secure authorization and authentication. The most common one is to have a username and password, just as a key to a house. With the right key you will be able to have access. Therefore it is important to have a strong and unique password that is hard to break. In addition to username and password, you can add a one-Time password which can be sent as a SMS, or authenticator app. As an admin it is important to know who has “admin”-access and to make sure that the reset password email is your own, not a stranger.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure to always have updated software, as hackers are constantly looking for old versions of software that have known security holes.</li>
        <li>Make sure that unauthorized people don’t have access to editing your files and other personal things, like passwords. HTTPS(HTTP Secure) is a safer version of HTTS, using this will protect the communication between the website and its users. </li>
        <li>Backup your website regularly to help you restore it quickly in case of a security hack or other issues.</li>
      </ul>
